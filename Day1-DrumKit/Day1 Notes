/*1. Data attributes:The data-* attribute is used to store custom data private to 
the page or application.
you can set your own data attribute just like standerd attribites like class,source ,id etc.
Data attributes are often referred to as data-* attributes, as they are always formatted like that. The word data, then a dash -, then other text you can make up.

/* Select any element with this data attribute and value */
[data-size="large"] {
  padding: 2rem;
  font-size: 125%;
}

2.transition:
 it provides a way to controll the speed of changing css property
 .example{
     transition:transition-prpert transition-duration transition-timing function transition-delay

transition	A shorthand property for setting the four transition properties into a single property
transition-delay	Specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect
transition-duration	Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds a transition effect takes to complete
transition-property	Specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for
transition-timing-function	Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect
 }
 //sorthand property
 div {
  transition: width 2s linear 1s;
}
we can also use all value
 div {
  transition: all 2s linear 1s;
}
div:hover{
    font-size:2px;
    background-color:blue;
    color:green
}
//we can also use transform with transition
div {
  transition: width 2s, height 2s, transform 2s;
}
div:hover {
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
  transform: rotate(180deg);

}
 here is three pair of transition property and transition duration
