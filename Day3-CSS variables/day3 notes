/*
 <label for="spacing">Spacing:</label>
  <input id="spacing" type="range" name="spacing" min="10" max="200" value="10" data-sizing="px">

here label is used for increasing the size of input elemnt 
The label text is not only visually associated with its corresponding text input; 
it is programmatically associated with it too. This means that, for example, a 
 reader will read out the label when the user is focused on the form input, making 
it easier for an assistive technology user to understand what data should be entered.

2.You can click the associated label to focus/activate the input,
 as well as the input itself. This increased hit area provides an advantage to
 anyone trying to activate the input, including those using a touch-screen device.
